**ASP .NET MVC User Table application**

I created this project to learn the ASP .NET MVC tech stack.

The code is good out of the box granted you have the correct development setup:

 - Windows OS
 - Install SQL Server
 - Install SQL Server Management Studio
 - Install Visual Studio
 - IIS (Optional to host)
 - Run the provided sql script on a database you create called "TestUsers"
 - Update the Web.config file to point to your localhost sql server
 - Host the code on IIS or run directly from Visual studio
